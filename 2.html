    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p><a href="https://omicstutorials.com/bioinformatics-tools-softwares-programmes/" target="_blank" title="Omics tutorials">Bioinformatic tools</a> are <strong>software programs</strong> that are designed for extracting the meaningful information from the mass of molecular biology / biological databases & to carry out sequence or structural analysis.</p>
    <p>Factors that must be taken into consideration when designing bioinformatics tools, software and programmes are:</p>
    <p>The end user (the biologist) may not be a frequent user of computer technology. These software tools must be made available over the internet given the global distribution of the scientific research community</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>categories of Bioinformatics Tools :</strong><br>
    There are both standard and customized products to meet the requirements of particular projects. There are data-mining software that retrieve data from genomic sequence databases and also visualization tools to analyze and retrieve information from proteomic databases. These can be classified as homology and similarity tools, protein functional analysis tools, sequence analysis tools and miscellaneous tools.</p>    
    <p>Here is a brief description of a few of these, everyday bioinformatics is done with sequence search programs like BLAST, sequence analysis programs, like the EMBOSS and Staden packages, structure prediction programs like THREADER or PHD or molecular imaging/modelling programs like RasMol and WHATIF.</p>
